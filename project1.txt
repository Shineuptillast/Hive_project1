Create a new directory in Hadoop file system 

hdfs dfs -mkdir /user/project1

Transfer the dataset from Local file system to hdfs 

hdfs dfs -put ./vehicle_data.csv /user/project1/

Creating an external table for the analysis

Creating an Internal Table storing data in ORC format:

create table vehicle_sales_orc(
ord_no int,
quantity int,
price_foreach float,
prd_lno int,
sales float,
status string,
qtr_id int,
month int,
year_id int,
product_type string,

product_code string,
phone string,
city string,
state string,
postal_code string,
country string,
territory string,
contact_lname string,
contact_fname string,
deal_size string
)
stored as orc;

from vehicle_sales insert overwrite table vehicle_sales_orc select *;



Creating an external table from the data stored in internal table in orc format.

create external table vehicle_sales_orc_(

status string,
qtr_id int,
month int,
year_id int,
product_type string,
msrp int,
product_code string,

city string,
state string,
postal_code string,
country string,
territory string,
contact_lname string,
contact_fname string,
deal_size string
)
stored as orc

from vehicle_sales insert overwrite table vehicle_sales_orc_ select *;


Valuable Insights:


1) Total sales per country 

select country, sum(sales) total_sales from vehicle_sales_orc_ group by country;


2)

3 Countries with the lowest overall sales

select country, sum(sales) total_sales from vehicle_sales_orc_ group by country order by total_sales limit 3;

3) Calculate total sales per year
select year_id, sum(sales) total_sales from vehicle_sales_orc_ group by year_id;

4) Total sales garner by each product line
select product_type, sum(sales) from vehicle_sales_orc_ group by product_type;

5)Total quantities per product type
select product_type, sum(quantity) total_quantity from vehicle_sales_orc_ group  by product_type;

6) Calculate total sales per quarter
select qtr_id, sum(sales) total_sales from vehicle_sales_orc_ group by qtr_id;

7) calculate quartery sales per country

select country, qtr_id, sum(sales) total_sales from vehicle_sales_orc_ group by country, qtr_id;

8) find the product for which maximum orders were placed
with sales_no as (select product_type, count(ord_no) total_orders from vehicle_sales_orc_ group by product_type), rank_cte as( select *, rank() over(order by total_orders desc) as rn from sales_no )
select product_type from rank_cte where rn=1;
9)In which quarter the sales was minimum

with qtr_sales as( select qtr_id, sum(sales) total_sales_perquarter from vehicle_sales_orc_ group by qtr_id) ,min_sales as (select *, rank() over(order by total_sales_perquarter asc) as lowest_sales from qtr_sales) select qtr_id from min_sales where lowest_sales =1;

10) In which month of every year the maximum sales are done
with sales as( select year_id, month, sum(sales) Total_sales_month from vehicle_sales_orc_ group by year_id, month) , max_sales_month as( select *, rank() over(partition by year_id order by Total_sales_month desc) as rn from sales) select year_id, month from max_sales_month where rn =1;
